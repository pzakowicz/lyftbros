---- Technology ------------------------------------

    - rewrite helper functions to be async await (remove ids from training page, instead get the id first)
    - alternatively do a table joint to get all information at one time
    - create a wrapper listener function which is also async and await functions which need to end first
- add webquries for all pages to RWF for mobile
- clean up css (get rid of unused things, find a better way to select element rather than giving everything ids)
- introduce react
- introduce redux
- implement mocha and write unit tests
- make accessible from outside of the network
