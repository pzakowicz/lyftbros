---- Technology ------------------------------------

- make mysql resistant to sql injection

- find a way to get values by id synchronously - async await !!!
    - rewrite helper functions to be async await (remove ids from training page, instead get the id first)
    - alternatively do a table joint to get all information at one time
    - create a wrapper listener function which is also async and await functions which need to end first

- make a progressive web app that can be installed on user phone (see 'to build' folder)

- clean up css (get rid of unused things, find a better way to select element rather than giving everything ids)
- learn mongo db and see if it would fit
- introduce react
- introduce redux
- implement mocha and write unit tests
- make accessible from outside of the network
